 ### Spotify Clips Saver - deployed at clips.hasanali.dev *!

 #### This is a full stack web application created to allow musicians to learn new music faster. 
 It allows users to log in with their Spotify Account and to save time stamps for portions of 
 songs they'd like to be played on repeat. Users can then easily play and pause their clips, and 
 delete and create new clips.

 #### Tech Stack:
##### Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS
##### Backend: Express.js, Axios, Firebase/Firestore
##### Deployed using Render.

###
** Unfortunately, Spotify stopped receiving applications from individual developers for public use of their APIs meaning that only useres added as a developer can use Spotify Clips Saver. **
